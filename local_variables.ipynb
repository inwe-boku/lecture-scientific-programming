    "There was a very brief hint in Lecture 2 about [shadowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing#Python), but we have never really discussed the concept of local and global variables in detail. Luckily it is quite intuitive up to a certain point, unfortunately surprising things happen if you dig even deeper.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that, in principle, code is exectued from top to bottom (of cource the code in the function body is executed when the function is called). Variables can't be accessed before they are defined, i.e. before a value has been assigned to them. This holds in general for all names in Python, i.e. also for functions (see lecture 2). Before a function is defined, it cannot be called.\n",
