    "**Instructions:** Load the image by using `plt.imread()`. This will return a three-dimensional array (width, height and colors) with values between zero and one. Using the formula `gray = red * 0.2126 + green * 0.7152 + blue * 0.0722`, convert the picture to shades of gray. Look at the shape of the image and pick the right axis by looking at the length of the array in each axis! You can first calculate a weighted version of the array by multiplying with a vector of length 3 (and the three weights) and then sum along the right axis. Check the shape of the gray image afterwards and plot it using `plt.imshow()` with the parameter `cmap='gray'`. It should be two-dimensional now.\n",

Multiplying the array with 255 will restore the original 8bit values (integer values between 0 and 255). After multiplying by 255 use `image = image.astype(int)` to convert the image to integer type. Plot the `image` using `plt.imshow()` to see the image and guess the result. Check the shape of the array. One of the axes is of length three - this is the color axis (red, green and blue). We want to map all colors to unique integers. This can be done by defining `colors = red  + green * 256 + blue * 256**2`. This is a unique mapping between the triples `(red, green, blue)` and the integers `color` similar to decimal digits (three values between 0 and 9 e.g. `(3, 5, 1)` can be mapped to a three digit number `3 + 5 * 10 + 1 * 100 = 153`). Then use `np.unique()` to get an array with unique colors (in the mapped form as in `color`). This can be used to determine the number of unique colors in the image. This value can also be used to calculate the percentage of the color space used.\n",
