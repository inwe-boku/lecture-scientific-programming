In this exercise you should decide which year to use as training data (of course you are not allowed to use 2019). First, rewrite the function `train_test_plot_with_holidays`. Add one parameter `resample`. The parameter tells the function, how the output of the model, i.e. `Y_test` and `prediction` should be resampled before you plot. It is a string such as `1h` or `d`. You can use the `insert` statement for pandas dataframes to insert your prediction into the `power_demand_at_hourly_test` dataframe and then do the resampling before you plot.\n",
