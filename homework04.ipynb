Below, you will find the variable `pv_production_at_2016_2024_twh` which reports the PV generation in the years 2016 to 2024. First, plot the years against historic production, i.e. plot a time series of the historic production.\n",

Assume that in each year in the period 2021 - 2030 PV generation is increased by the same amount and the goal of additional 11TWh/year is reached in 2030. Calculate the yearly increase in PV production and store it in the variable `yearly_addition_twh`. Then create a timeseries `pv_production_at_2020_2030_twh` with the PV generation in the year 2020 and the projected generation for the years 2021 to 2030. Plot this timeseries in the same plot as the historic generation data before!\n",
