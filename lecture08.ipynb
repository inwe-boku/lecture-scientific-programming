    "\n",

    "## How to program without Datalore?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run Python as scripts or use Jupyter Notebooks. The latter is _very_ similar to Datalore.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) on your computer if you use Windows or Mac, use [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or the package manager of your distribution (e.g. apt in Ubuntu/Debian) if you run Linux. [This video might help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrMOrMb8-3s), but you probably can find other (better?) instructions yourself too.\n",
    "- Use an Editor such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (not opensource, but really powerful, free community edition and free education license), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) (free and opensource) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",
    "- Use [Datalore](images/datalore.jetbrains.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to debug?\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging is important to understand what your code does. Use print statements or special debugging tools! There are great tutorials out there how to learn good debugging techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to version control?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, software development is never done without version control systems, such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/). When working with notebooks things are messy anyway, so it might be less important. But you should definitely checkout Git, when you write scripts and modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to do testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can save a lot of time if you invest time into proper [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing). This means you write code, which checks if your code does the right thing - automatically. This is similar to the tests you have seen in most homework exercises - but of course, you have to write the solution *and* the test on your own. If you need correct results, you probably need automatic ways of testing your code."
