    "# Exercise 3 - Determine fossil backup power generation in system with high shares of renewables\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction to some vocabulary:\n",
    "- *Load* is the consumption of electricity in the network\n",
    "- *Residual load* is the residual demand for electricity on the network, which cannot be covered by the generation of solar PV and wind power. The residual load has to be covered by thermal power plants fuelled by e.g. coal or gas.\n",
    "- *Generation*: Actual production of a power plant at a certain point in time\n",
    "- *Capacity*: Theoretical maximum generation of a power plant. E.g. a solar park with 1 MW *capacity* may *generate* only 0.1MW in a certain hour because of low solar irradiance (e.g. due to low position of the sun or clouds).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are asked to design the power system of Kakanien which contains a high share of renewable generation. Assume that the residual load (i.e. the load after reducing it by photovoltaic (PV) and wind power electricity generation) is supplied by a gas power plant, i.e. the remaining gap in load after accounting for renewable generation is filled by gas power generation. The time series of load, wind, and PV generation are given below (`load_kakanien_mw`, `generation_wind_power_kakanien_mw`, `generation_pv_kakanien_mw`). It is the average power in the given time period (hourly data).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, write a function `residual_load_mw(load_mw, generation_wind_power_mw, generation_pv_mw)` which calculates the residual load in the system, i.e. the difference between load and wind power and PV generation (`load_mw - generation_wind_power_mw - generation_pv_mw`). Use the function to calculate the residual load in Kakanien and store it in the variable `residual_load_kakanien_mw`. Plot the resulting timeseries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we want to know, how big (in terms of capacity) the backup gas power plant has to be. And we also want to know, how much this power plant has to generate combined during the whole period. For that purpose, calculate the maximum of the residual load timeseries and store it in `gas_capacity_kakanien_mw`. This is the necessary capacity.  `numpy` has a function to calculate the maximum of an array, find it by googling. Second, calculate the sum of the residual load timeseries and store it in `gas_generation_kakanien_mwh`. This is how much the power plant has to generate during the whole period. `numpy` has a function to calculate the sum of an array, find it by googling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus part: The approach described above may not work if the renewable generation becomes very high. Instead of `generation_wind_power_kakanien_mw` use `generation_wind_power_bonus_mw` defined below and redo the exercise. Can you find the semantic bug in that case? Can you fix it? Store the results in `gas_capacity_bonus_mw` and `gas_generation_bonus_mw`."
