You can imagine the computer being able to calculate decimal numbers with a certain length, i.e. a certain number of decimal digits per number. For example, if the computer can do computations with numbers up to 5 decimal digits, the computer would use `0.3333` to represent $\\frac{1}{3}$, because it is the closest decimal number with 5 digits. Of course, this would introduce a numerical error, which is hopefully (!) small. This could be called _rounding error_, but it would be a bit sloppy and misleading, because there is no explicit rounding taking place - the error is caused only by the computational precision introduced by the fact that the computer can handle only numbers with a finite decimal representation. Usually we refer to this error as [numerical error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_error).\n",

Numbers which have a finite decimal representation, do not have necessarily a finite binary representation and vice versa. With $1.45$ we were (un)lucky to use a number, which has a finite decimal represantation, but the closes number which has a finite binary representation, is actually smaller than 1.45:"
